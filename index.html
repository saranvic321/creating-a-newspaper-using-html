            The Tamil Nadu government on Monday urged the Centre to allocate an additional 50 lakh doses of Covid vaccines every week, to enable the state in vaccinating all the uncovered eligible persons by the end of October, apart from administering the second dose to those due to receive them.

            Chief Minister M K Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, citing the “resounding success” of two mega Covid vaccination camps held on September 12 and 19, where a cumulative 45-lakh odd jabs were administered to the public across the state.
            
            “The Government of India has supplied 3.97 crore doses of Covid vaccine and 2.21 crore (0.5 ml) AD syringes to the state, till September 19, 2021. By deriving more doses out of the each 10 ml vial, the State has been able to vaccinate 4.13 crore persons in Government Covid Vaccination Centres. The state realises that despite the levels of vaccinations achieved in the state, it still has a large eligible population which is yet to get vaccinated and this continues to make the state vulnerable for Covid cases,” Stalin wrote.
            
            He added, “In our estimation, the state is easily capable of utilising 50 lakh vaccine doses every week…I have directed my officers to closely liaise with the officials of the Ministry of Health, Government of India and provide all necessary information to enable the state to get the additional doses. I hence request you to kindly facilitate in providing the additional doses of 50 lakh Covid vaccines to the state along with equal number of 0.5 ml of AD Syringes or 1 ml/2 ml syringes to the state every week.”</p></div>

          “Do you remember an incident from last week or last month which incredibly upset you? Do you feel it with the same intensity? Definitely the pain would have lessened. Or it could have completely withered away. An exam is not bigger than your life. If you are depressed, please approach the people who you are close with, like parents, teachers, friends and let yourself out. Fear, anxiety, dejection and depression are things which disappear after a while. But suicide, the decision to your end your life is a life time punishment to your parents who love you. Don’t forget this,” he urged. </p>
					
					<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>
